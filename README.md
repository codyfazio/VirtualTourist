# VirtualTourist

This is the fourth portfolio project in Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree. 

The app allows the user to create collections of images from Flickr based on locations of their choosing. The user is first presented with a map view. They can drop a pin on a location by using a long press gesture. Upon tapping the pin, they can view a collection of photos related to that location produced from a Flickr search. Both the pin and collection are persistant. The user can also choose to delete selected images from the collection, or create a brand new collection for the location. 

Persistence is done through Core Data. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know!
